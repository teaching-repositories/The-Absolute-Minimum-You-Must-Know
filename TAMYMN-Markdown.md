# Markdown: The Absolute Minimum You Must Know

Markdown is a simple formatting language used in plain text documents. This guide will teach you just enough to start using basic Markdown in your writing.

## Headings

To make a heading, add # symbols before the heading title. The number of # matches the heading level. 

```
# Heading 1 
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

Try making a level 2 heading with your name.

## Bold and Italics

Surround text with **two asterisks** to make it bold or *one asterisk* to italicize it. 

**This is bold text.**

*This is italicized text.* 

Try making your name bold.

## Lists

Make bullet point lists with - dashes like:

```
- Item 1 
- Item 2
```

And numbered lists with numbers followed by . like:

```  
1. First item
2. Second item
```

Make a 3 item bullet list of your favorite foods.

## Links

Add links like this:

```
[text](https://www.example.com)
```

Make a link to your favorite website.

That covers the absolute basics of Markdown! You can now make headings, formatting, lists, and links.
