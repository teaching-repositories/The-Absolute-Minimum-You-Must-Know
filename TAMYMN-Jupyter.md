Here is a basic guide to Jupyter Notebooks in Python:

# Jupyter Notebooks: The Absolute Minimum You Must Know

Jupyter Notebooks allow you to write and execute Python code blocks interactively. Here's an intro to their basic functionality:

## Install Jupyter

Install the Jupyter package:

```
pip install jupyter
```

## Start the Notebook Server

Run `jupyter notebook` to start the server. This will open the dashboard in your browser.

## Create a New Notebook 

Click New > Python Notebook to create a new notebook.

## Code Cells

Write Python code in the pre-made cells. Run a cell using Shift + Enter or the â–¶ button.

## Markdown Cells 

Add markdown cells for text explanations by changing the cell type. Use markdown for headings, lists, etc.

## Adding Cells

Use the + button to add new code and markdown cells.

## Kernel

The kernel executes the code in your notebook. Restart or change kernels from the Kernel menu.

## Saving

Save your .ipynb notebook with File > Save.

That covers the basics of working with Python and Jupyter Notebooks! You can now write and execute Python in an interactive environment.
