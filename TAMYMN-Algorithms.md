# Algorithms in Python: The Absolute Minimum You Must Know

Algorithms are sequences of instructions for solving problems.

## Sorting

Sort lists in ascending order.

```python
sorted([5, 2, 3, 1]) # [1, 2, 3, 5]
```

## Searching 

Search elements in data structures.

```python 
def binary_search(list, item):
  # Return index of item if found
```

## Graph Algorithms 

Traverse nodes and edges in graphs.

```python
def breadth_first_search(graph, start):
  # Traverse graph from start  
```

## Dynamic Programming

Break problems into subproblems.

```python
def fib(n):
  # Calculate nth Fibonacci number
```  

## Recursion

Functions call themselves to repeat logic.

```python
def factorial(x):
  if x == 1: return 1
  return x * factorial(x-1)
```

Algorithms utilize patterns like sorting, searching, recursion to solve generic problems efficiently.
