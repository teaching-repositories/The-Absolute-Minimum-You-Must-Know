# Python: The Absolute Minimum You Must Know

Python is a popular programming language used for web development, data science, AI, and more. Here are the key things to know when getting started with Python:

## Print and Output

Print to the console using the `print()` function:

```python
print("Hello World")
```

## Variables

Store values in variables like:

```python 
name = "John"
age = 25
```

## Data Types

Python has several main data types including strings, integers, floats, booleans, lists, and dictionaries.

```python
my_string = "Hello"
my_int = 25
my_bool = True
my_list = [1, 2, 3] 
my_dict = {"name": "John"}
```

## Conditional Logic 

Use `if`, `else` and `elif` statements for conditional logic:

```python
if x > 5:
  print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
  print("x is equal to 5")  
else:
  print("x is less than 5")
```

## Loops

Loop through data structures with `for` and `while` loops:

```python
for x in [1, 2, 3]:
  print(x)

i = 0  
while i < 5:
  print(i)
  i += 1 
```

That covers the absolute basics of Python programming! You can now store data, use conditionals and loops, and print output.
