Here is an introduction to polymorphism in Python:

# Polymorphism in Python: The Absolute Minimum You Must Know

Polymorphism allows objects to take on different forms.

## Method Overriding

Child classes can override methods from parents:

```python
class Animal:
  def make_sound(self):
    print("Some sound")

class Dog(Animal):
  def make_sound(self):
    print("Bark") 
```

## Same Interface, Different Behavior

The make_sound() method behaves differently for Dogs vs Animals.

## Duck Typing

Objects of different unrelated types can have matching interfaces.

```python
class Duck:
  def quack(self):
    print("Quack!")
      
class Radio:
  def quack(self):
    print("Quack!")
```

## Callable Objects

Objects can behave like functions using the `__call__` method.

```python
class Adder:
  def __call__(self, x, y):
    return x + y
```  

Polymorphism allows generalized code using incompatible types.
