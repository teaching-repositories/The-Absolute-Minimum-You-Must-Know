# Computational Thinking: The Absolute Minimum You Must Know

Computational thinking involves strategies for problem solving.

## Decomposition 

Break down problems into smaller, manageable parts.

## Pattern Recognition 

Identify similarities or patterns in data.

## Abstraction

Focus on important information, ignore unnecessary details.

## Algorithms  

Develop step-by-step instructions for solving problems.

## Evaluating Tradeoffs

Compare solutions for efficiency.

## Iterative Refinement

Improve solutions iteratively.

## Generalizing 

Extend solutions to apply to a broader range of problems.

## Programming

Use a computer to automate solutions. 

Computational thinking develops the skillset for solving complex problems effectively. The key is breaking down problems methodically to make them tractable.
